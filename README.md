random customizations i've made to my dayz server including:

DISCLAIMER: if anyone besides me ever tries to use these, be forewarned: all this shit is highly tuned for singleplayer PvE.
cfgrandompresets.xml in particular - nearly all military and police zombies spawn with armor and helmets

* heavily modified init.c which sets up a few "types" of survivor and picks one at random
* windstride's clothing pack config
* spurgle's bags config
* mmg gear and storage config
* morty's weapons config
* weapon expansion config
* tweaked types/spawnable types/random presets for each mod and vanilla items for chernarus, livonia, and melkart
