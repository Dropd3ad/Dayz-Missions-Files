**DISCLAIMER**: if anyone besides me ever tries to use these, be forewarned: all this shit is highly tuned for singleplayer PvE.

chernarus and melkart in particular have highly armored military and police zombies.

these are my server configs for the following maps: chernarus (both regular and winter versions), livonia, melkart, takistan, namalsk, chiemsee, esseker, banov, eden, and valning.

i run the following mods on most of these maps:
* MMG gear (with country camo expansion, diff camo types spawn based on the map season/environment)
* spurglez bags (same as MMG, relevant camo types for the environment spawn only)
* windstride clothing
* uncuepa's clothing
* blackout weapons (pretty much everything except LMGs)
* weapon expansion (the FiveseveN, AK-system replacements, mosin, SKS, shotguns, and a few scopes)
