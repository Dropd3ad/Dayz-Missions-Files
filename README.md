**DISCLAIMER**: if anyone besides me ever tries to use these, be forewarned: all this shit is highly tuned for singleplayer PvE.
cfgrandompresets.xml in particular - nearly all military and police zombies spawn with armor and helmets. heavy military zombies can
spawn with MMG MK V armor and armored helmets. (except in namalsk, which is hard enough already without that)

random customizations i've made to my dayz server including:

* heavily modified init.c for chernarus and melkart which sets up a few "types" of survivor and picks one at random
* windstride's clothing pack config
* spurgle's bags config
* mmg gear and storage config
* morty's weapons config
* weapon expansion config
* tweaked types/spawnable types/random presets for each mod and vanilla items for chernarus, livonia, melkart, takistan, and namalsk
