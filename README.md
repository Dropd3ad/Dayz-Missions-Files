**DISCLAIMER**: if anyone besides me ever tries to use these, be forewarned: all this shit is highly tuned for singleplayer PvE.

police and military zombies spawn with armor, and TLOU mutants spawn along with regular zombies. the mutants have a ton of HP.

these are my server configs for the following maps: chernarus (both regular and winter versions), livonia, melkart, takistan, namalsk, chiemsee, esseker, banov, lux, valning, and iztek.

i run the following mods on most of these maps:
* MMG gear (with country camo expansion, diff camo types spawn based on the map season/environment)
* spurglez bags (same as MMG, relevant camo types for the environment spawn only)
* windstride clothing
* uncuepa's clothing
* blackout weapons (pretty much everything except LMGs and SMGs)
* hooch's heat (pistols, the galil ARs)
* fidov pack IV (pistols, PSG-1, hoods, the giant katana, diff camo scheme gorka outfits)
* stalker EVR storm anomaly chernarus
* knife pack
* additional medic supplies (got tired of just vanilla gas masks)
